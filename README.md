# openclaw-skill-uexcorp-sc

⭐ Advanced OpenClaw/ShibaClaw skill for Star Citizen trade data and market management via UEXcorp API.

## What it does

This skill transforms your agent into a professional Star Citizen trade advisor, leveraging the [UEXcorp](https://uexcorp.space) community database to maximize your profits.

### 📈 Market Intelligence
- 💰 **Live Prices**: Query commodity buy/sell prices by terminal or globally.
- ⛏️ **Mining Data**: Track raw material prices and find the best selling points for ores/gases.
- 🛸 **Logistics**: Get ship/vehicle cargo capacities and purchase prices.
- 🪐 **Navigation**: Map terminals, planets, moons, and star systems.
- 🗺️ **Route Optimization**: Generate the most profitable trade routes based on your ship's capacity.

### 🚀 Advanced Features
- 🖼️ **Image-to-Post**: Upload a photo of an item; the agent identifies it, researches the current lowest market prices, and helps you create a listing.
- 📤 **Market Contribution**: Update the community database with live prices you find in-game.
- 📝 **Trade Postings**: Create WTS (Want to Sell) or WTB (Want to Buy) listings directly via the API.
- � **Post-Trade Analysis**: Calculate net profit, margin percentages, and trade efficiency (profit per SCU/hour).
